# Minesweeper-3DS
A simple minesweeper port for 3DS.

This is one of my first 3DS homebrew apps, so I'm fairly inexperienced with Citro.

## Building
Use make with the makefile. Nothing special should be required.
An batch file to build it has been included as well as one to also build a CIA using bannertool and makerom.
